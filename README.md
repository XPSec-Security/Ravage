  <h3>RAVAGE | PowerShell C2 Weaponized</h3>
  <p>stay stealth.</p>
</div>

## Overview

**RAVAGE** is a Command & Control (C2) framework designed for cybersecurity professionals, red teams, and penetration testers. It provides a secure, modular architecture with dynamic configuration, strong encryption, and advanced evasion techniques to simulate realistic attack scenarios.

> **Note:** This framework is intended for educational purposes and authorized security testing only. Always obtain proper authorization before conducting security assessments.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between C2 server, admin interface, and agents
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Full SSL/TLS support with AES-256 encryption and random IV
- **Multi-Layer Obfuscation**: Advanced PowerShell and HTA obfuscation techniques
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Modern web interface with real-time agent monitoring
- **Secure File Operations**: Encrypted file transfer capabilities
- **Traffic Masquerading**: Header spoofing and content mimicking
- **Timing Randomization**: Configurable jitter for agent communication
- **In-Memory Execution**: Minimized disk operations to reduce forensic footprint

## 🚀 Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required Python version
Python 3.8+

# Required packages
pip install flask pyyaml cryptography
```

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XPSec-Security/Ravage.git
cd Ravage
```

2. **Create SSL certificates**
```bash
mkdir certs
# For development/testing (self-signed)
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/server.key -out certs/server.crt -days 365 -nodes

# For production environments, use Let's Encrypt or proper CA-signed certificates
```

3. **Configure the framework**
```bash
cp profiles/profile.yaml.example profiles/profile.yaml
# Edit profiles/profile.yaml with your settings (see Configuration section)
```

4. **Launch the framework**
```bash
python main.py
# or
python3 main.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration in Depth

The Ravage framework uses YAML configuration profiles located in the `profiles/` directory to customize all aspects of operation.

### Core Configuration (`profile.yaml`)

```yaml
teamserver:
  bind:
    host: "0.0.0.0"      # Admin interface binding address
    port: 2053           # Admin interface port
    response_headers:    # Custom headers for disguising server identity
      - "Server: Microsoft-IIS/8.5"
      - "X-Powered-By: ASP.NET"

agent:
  sleep_time: 6          # Time in seconds between agent check-ins
  jitter: 20             # Random timing variation (percent)
  debug: false           # Enable/disable debug mode in agent

operators:
  - name: "operator1"    # Operator username
    credentials:
      password: "secure_password"  # Use strong passwords in production

aes_key:
  - data:
      key: "s3cure_AES_Key_Must_Be_32_Chars_Long"  # AES key for encryption (32+ chars)

ssl:
  enabled: true          # Enable SSL/TLS
  cert_file: "certs/server.crt"  # Path to certificate
  key_file: "certs/server.key"   # Path to private key
  ssl_version: "TLSv1_2"         # SSL/TLS version
  ciphers: "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5"    # Cipher configuration

listeners:
  - id: "main_listener"  # Unique listener identifier
    profile:
      description: "Default C2 listener"
      bind:
        host: "0.0.0.0"  # Agent listener binding address
        port: 443        # Agent listener port
        protocol: "https"  # Communication protocol
      upstream:
        hosts:
          - "your-domain.com"  # Domain (or ip) for agent communications
      http:
        user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36"      # Agent user-agent
        uris:
          - "/account/login"    # Agent communication endpoint
          - "/search/?q=rvge"   # Dropper delivery endpoint
        request_headers:        # Custom request headers
          - "Accept: */*"
          - "Referer: https://your-domain.com/"
        response_headers:       # Custom response headers
          - "content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8"
          - "server: ESF"
          - "cf-cache-status: HIT"
```

## 🛠️ Usage Guide

### Starting the Framework

```bash
python main.py
# or
python3 main.py
```

This launches:
- **Admin Server**: `https://your-ip:2053` (Web dashboard)
- **C2 Server**: `https://your-ip:443` (Agent communication)

### Access Control

Navigate to the admin dashboard and authenticate with your operator credentials:
```
Username: [as configured in profile.yaml]
Password: [as configured in profile.yaml]
```

### Agent Deployment

1. **Generate Agent**:
   - Use the dashboard to generate a customized PowerShell agent
   - Configure listener, obfuscation level, and connection parameters

2. **Delivery Methods**:
   - **Direct Execution**: PowerShell one-liner
   - **Dropper**: PowerShell full dropper
   - **HTA File**: HTML Application with obfuscation
